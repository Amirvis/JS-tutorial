/* You can add an script tag to the html file to write js code,
or you can add a src attribute to the script tag to link a js file to your html file;
pay attention to the html file.. */

/* for running js code first install node js then open the terminal and type node "your js file's name",
or you can also use your browser console. */

// Personally, I run my code through Node and don't use the console except when absolutely necessary.

console.log("Hello JavaScript!");  // use console.log() to print something on the console

// use node or your browser console to see the output
