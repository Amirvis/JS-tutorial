/*

This repository is the first version of the JavaScript code-based training series;
In this tutorial, I tried to cover many basic topics,
although some of the main JavaScript topics such as DOM, Fetch APi, AJAX, BOM, etc. were not covered.
But over time, in the second edition of this series,
I will try to provide all JS intervals with additional explanations and more examples for all dear junior programmers.
